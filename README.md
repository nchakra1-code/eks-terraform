terraform init
```

Edit the below file according to your configuration

`vim kube_terraform/ToDo-App/backend.tf`

add below code

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "S3-BUCKET-NAME"
    key    = "backend/TFSTATE-FILE.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "DYNAMODB-TABLE-NAME"
  }
}
```

Let's set up the variable for our Infrastructure and create one file with the name of terraform.tfvars inside kube_terraform/ToDo-App/backend.tf and add the below conntent into that file.

```
REGION          = "us-east-1"
PROJECT_NAME    = "ToDo-App"
VPC_CIDR        = "10.0.0.0/16"
PUB_SUB1_CIDR   = "10.0.1.0/24"
PUB_SUB2_CIDR   = "10.0.2.0/24"
PRI_SUB3_CIDR   = "10.0.3.0/24"
PRI_SUB4_CIDR   = "10.0.4.0/24"
```


It's time to build the infrastructure

`terraform init`

The below command will tell you what terraform is going to create.

`terraform plan`

Finally, HIT the below command to create the infrastructure...

`terraform apply`

type yes, and it will prompt you for permission or use --auto-approve in the command above.
